### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

It's almost perfect, Â but I need to explore more on, CSS Grid so I can improve the layout across all screen sizes. Also, I tried SASS/SCSS the first time. It turned out pretty good. But I am still on the beginner level when it comes to SASS, I am continuing to improve myself on it.
